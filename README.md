Image Classification with TensorFlow and DenseNet201
This project demonstrates an image classification application using TensorFlow with the DenseNet201 architecture. The application is built using Streamlit to provide an interactive web interface.

Features
Upload and classify images using a pre-trained DenseNet201 model.
Display the top predicted classes with probabilities.
Streamlit web interface for easy interaction.

Installation
Clone the repository:

sh
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/image-classification-tensorflow-densenet201.git
cd image-classification-tensorflow-densenet201
Create a virtual environment:

sh
Copy code
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
Install the dependencies:

sh
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Running the Application
Start the Streamlit app:

sh
Copy code
streamlit run app.py
Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:8501 to access the application.

Usage
Upload an Image:

Use the file uploader in the Streamlit app to upload an image.
View Predictions:

Once the image is uploaded, the app will display the top predicted classes along with their probabilities.
